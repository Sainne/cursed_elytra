# 🐦 Cursed Elytra
A Minecraft datapack that nerfs the elytra outside The End, in order to make other transportation methods more viable.
## ✔️ Features
* When you equip an elytra it becomes cursed with "Curse of Flight"
* Curse of Flight only gives debuffs outside The End.
* When flying you receive Weakness II, Hunger X and Slowness II, as such having the elytra constantly equipped is not ideal.
* In the Nether specifically you start to burn constantly, a potion of fire resistance will be needed to fly in there.
* The Elytra coming from The End, it gets the same weakness to water that enderman have, as such when equipped, water and rain damage you constantly in them. When it rains, do not fly.
## 🎮 Player recommendations!
* Since the elytra gives hunger when flying, it can be partially countered with good amounts of quality food.
* In the End the elytra is practically unchanged, it may be a good idea then to make a base there if you want something massive in scale.
* In PVP the elytra is still pretty good since your hitbox is very reduced when flying, but the weakness effect ends up balancing this. Make a decision then.
## 📝 Server owner recommendations!
* Since this nerfs the Elytra, you nerfed the main exploration method people use, try to consider mods that buff horses.
* And since people like using it as well for moving around in their bases, including mods that buff minecarts as well is also a good idea.
